\usage{
guide_subtitle(title = waiver(), open = "{.", close = "}", theme = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{title}{A \verb{<character[1]>} containing text to use as subtitle. Text
formatting is discussed in details.}

\item{open, close}{A \verb{<character[1]>} delimiter indicating where colour
formatting begins (\code{open}) and ends (\code{close}).}

\item{theme}{A \code{\link[ggplot2:theme]{<theme>}} object to style the guide individually or
differently from the plot's theme settings. The \code{theme} argument in the
guide overrides and is combined with the plot's theme.}
}
\value{
A \verb{<Guide>} object.

\description{
This guides formats a piece of text with colours determined from the scale.

\details{
\subsection{Text formatting}{

Chunks of text are formatted as follows: the title is chopped up into
pieces split by the \code{open} and \code{close} delimiters. When the \code{open} delimiter
is followed by an integer, that integer is matched up against the scale's
breaks. The piece of text between that \code{open} delimiter and the associated
\code{close} delimiter is that coloured with the break's colour.

For example, in the title
\code{"A {.1 quick} brown {.3 fox} jumps over the {.2 lazy dog}."}, the word
\code{"quick"} is given the scale's first colour, \code{"fox"} is given the third
colour and \code{"lazy dog"} is given the second colour. The first space after
the integer index gets trimmed.

When there is no text inside the braces other than the index, the scale's
labels are inserted as text.

While implemented as a legend guide, it takes style options from the
\code{plot.subtitle} theme element. As it is not a true subtitle, there might
be complications if other guides co-occupy the \code{"top"} legend position.
}

\subsection{Right-to-left scripts}{

The typesetting of this guide is primitive and only concerns itself with
placing text pieces, not individual glyphs. The only consideration given
to right-to-left script is that a line is converted from LtR to RtL when
all pieces of text on a line contain characters from RtL character sets.
Bidirectional text is given no consideration within this function. Glyphs
that should have ligatures in normal text, but are in separate pieces will
probably not render as ligatures. The task of actually rendering what is
within pieces of text, is handled by the graphics device, which have varying
degrees of modern text feature support. The author of this function,
who only knows LtR natural languages, profusely apologises for this
inconvenience.

\examples{
# A standard plot
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point()

# Typical use case
p + scale_colour_discrete(
  name = "Cars with {.1 four}, {.2 five}, {.3 six} or {.4 eight} cylinders.",
  guide = "subtitle"
)

# If there is no text in between the delimiters, the scale's `labels` are
# substituted.
p + scale_colour_discrete(
  labels = c("FOUR", "5", "Six", "foobar"),
  name   = "Cars with {.1}, {.2}, {.3} or {.4} cylinders.",
  guide  = "subtitle"
)

# Using different text delimiters
p + guides(colour = guide_subtitle(
  "Cars with <1 four>, <2 five>, <3 six> or <4 eight> cylinders.",
  open = "<", close = ">"
))

# # For use with \{ggtext\}, mix html with the open and closing delimiters.
# # Leave out the '\' before quotation marks, it didn't document without
# # these backslashes :(
# p +
#   scale_colour_discrete(
#     name  = \"Cars with {.1}, <b>{.2 five}</b>, {.3} or {.4} <i>cylinders</i>.\",
#     guide = "subtitle"
#   ) +
#   theme(plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_markdown())
